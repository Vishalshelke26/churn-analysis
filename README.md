📊 Customer Churn Prediction Dataset
🧾 About Dataset

Customer churn prediction is a critical business problem for subscription-based and service-driven companies. This dataset is a synthetic yet business-realistic customer churn dataset created to simulate real-world customer behavior for machine learning and data analytics applications.

The dataset combines:

Customer demographics

Product usage patterns

Billing and payment history

Customer support interactions

Engagement and feedback metrics

to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

The target variable churn is generated using business-driven rules combined with probabilistic noise, ensuring realistic feature relationships rather than random labeling.

This dataset is suitable for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive modeling

Explainable AI

Business dashboards

End-to-end ML deployment

🎯 Use Cases

Customer churn prediction

Customer retention strategy analysis

Feature engineering & model evaluation

Business intelligence dashboards

Explainable AI (SHAP, feature importance)

End-to-end ML deployment (Streamlit / Flask)

📈 Business Problem

Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting customer churn in advance, businesses can:

Identify high-risk customers early

Reduce revenue loss

Improve customer satisfaction

Design targeted retention campaigns

This dataset enables data scientists and analysts to simulate and solve a real-world customer retention problem using machine learning and analytics.
